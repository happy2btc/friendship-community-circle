  <h1>🌼 Tend to the Mutual Aid Scrolls</h1>
  <p>This space honors the commitments we make to one another—not through transaction, but through trust.</p>

  <h2>🧭 What Is Mutual Aid?</h2>
  <p>Mutual aid is the practice of showing up for each other. It’s not charity. It’s solidarity. It’s the architecture of care, built from shared needs and shared offerings.</p>

  <div class="affirmation">
    “We affirm that support is not earned—it is offered. We affirm that visibility is not requested—it is granted.”
  </div>
<h2>🌿 How We Tend the Scrolls</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We document needs and offerings with clarity and care</li>
  <li>We honor pauses, and respond without urgency</li>
  <li>We treat every update as a lantern lit for the group</li>
  <li>We hold space for emotional check-ins alongside technical flows</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧭 What Is This Space?</h2>
<p>This is where you name your project, your struggle, your need. It’s where you say:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“I’m building something, but I’m stuck.”</li>
  <li>“I’m learning, but I need a guide.”</li>
  <li>“I’m overwhelmed, and I need someone to witness.”</li>
  <li>“I have something to offer—skills, time, care.”</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t ask for credentials. We ask for clarity. We don’t offer fixes. We offer presence.</p>
