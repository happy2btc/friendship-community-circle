// DELETED: This function's code has been removed from the repository.
// If you need any of the previous behaviors (map-visitor, sync-visits), reintroduce a new function
// with explicit intent. The Circle Pulse UI now aggregates activity client-side and does not
// require server-side recording of point events.

// Intentionally return 410 for any invocation to signal deprecation.
