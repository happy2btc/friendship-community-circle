# Message to Nathan

Hi Nathan,

Iâ€™ve been tracing and restoring a few frontend and backend flows, and Iâ€™ve documented everything clearly in VS Code so itâ€™s easy to follow when youâ€™re ready.

Youâ€™ll find two folders in the project:

- `Findings-for-Nathan-FE` â€” frontend notes and scroll revisions  
- `Findings-for-Nathan-RE` â€” backend observations and restoration paths

Each folder contains markdown files with dated entries. Nothing has been pushed to GitHubâ€”just local revisions and reflections. Some highlights:

- Rewrote `exchange.html` to remove wallet dependency and prepare for Supabase connection
- Updated `index.html` sign-up logic to include metadata (`name`, `phone`, `wallet`) using `options.data`
- Reviewed Supabase tables and noted gaps in submission flow and metadata storage

Let me know when youâ€™d like to review or walk through anything together. Iâ€™ve kept the notes light and focused so theyâ€™re easy to scan. No pressureâ€”just wanted to share whatâ€™s been restored so far.

Gratefully,  
Thomas


Hey Nathan, the video was 3 hours and 50 minutes. It overwhelmed my editor. I am able to view it. I used the npm run dev.
I am having Gemini go line by line and explain what the code does. Starting with index.html it said else { window.location.href = "menu.html"; } and it goes to ðŸŒ± Affirm Your Values which is a page with the page buttons. However, on the GitHub public it opens the full Affirm Your Values with a what do you believe in? and 6 items t check and an affirm and ontinue button.
The GitHub code line 117 is else window location.href="affirm.html". and later on line 134 else window location.href="menu.html". 
I assume that when we push the local index.html it will be like what I am seeing locally. for now when I click the affirm & continue it goes to the affirm.html that shows the menu. Now the question is why is menu.htm;  going to the affirm.html menu.
