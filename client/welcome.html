            The Friendship Community Circle is a community of my friends. We gather as members, practice mutual support, encourage action, and award points for activities. There are activities ranging from profiles, forms about ways to exchange energy and service, ‘suggestions, discussions and voting on agreements’,to creating circles in circles. The goal is to have a network of small interconnected communities, like mycelium, to self-govern from a grass roots decentralized self-sovereign autonomous level. 
            The purpose is to establish an environment of positive thought, good cheer, natural giving, non violent communication, and unconditional acceptance of what is and each other.
